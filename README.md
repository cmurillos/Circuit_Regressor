# Circuit_Regressor
Given an AC impedance-frequency curve, equivalent circuits are calculated for this curve using symbolic regression.
The generated circuits only have R,C,L elements, their maximum number and range of values ​​can be set in advance.

Note: this code was developed using to a lesser extent the algorithm described in the article [Bayesian Symbolic Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08892)
